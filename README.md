## Project Motivation<a name="description"></a>

This project analyzes the 2023 Stack Overflow survey data to explore developer demographics and career trajectories. 

Focusing on income distribution, educational backgrounds, and geographic concentrations, the analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns within the global developer community. Through visualization techniques and data interpretation, the project provides insights into factors influencing earning potential, educational pathways, and regional disparities. The findings contribute to understanding the dynamics of software development and inform strategies for talent development and recruitment in the tech industry.

Questions to be answered in the analysis:
1. How is developer income distributed across the field?
2. What range of educational backgrounds do developers possess?
3. In which countries do we find a high concentration of experienced developers?
